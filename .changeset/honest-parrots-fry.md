EVMcrispr v0.5.0
This version comes with significantly refactoring of the code, moving most of the AragonOS-related code to its module. This means that from now on, EVMcrispr can be used for more than just creating AragonOS votes. It is now a tool to create scripts that perform transactions to EVM-compatible blockchains, including AragonOS votes. So now we are closer to a more general tool that can be used to claim your farming rewards or send funds to multiple addresses, and both things can be done from an address or a DAO.
